## About Me

Hey there! I’m a software engineer with a passion for robotics and a knack for seeing both the forest and the trees. I love diving into complex systems, not just to understand how all the pieces fit together, but also to explore the unexpected connections between them. Whether it’s motors, control loops, or middleware, I’m always trying to see how it all clicks — and more importantly, how to make it better.

What really drives me is solving tough problems with smart, creative solutions. I bring a mix of systems thinking (seeing the whole puzzle) and associative thinking (spotting links others might miss), which helps me come up with ideas that are both practical and innovative.

I'm constantly learning, tinkering, and pushing the boundaries of what robotic software can do. From tuning a stubborn PID loop to wiring up a new interface node, I’m happiest when I’m building something that works — and works well.

This blog is a space where I document what I'm working on, how I solved it (or didn’t), and what I learned along the way. Whether you're into ROS 2, embedded hardware, or just curious how this all comes together, I hope you find something useful here.
